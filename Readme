SIMPLE STACK

A stack implementation, written in C. This stack was designed to be as simple
as possible, whilst still being reusable.

The project is licensed under the 3 clause BSD license.

Feel free to use this in your own projects.

By the way, if you don't use multiple threads, or work on an architecture
without preemptive scheduling, it would be possible to remove the
#define MULTITHREAD line from the stack.h file, which removes thread safety and
thereby speeds up execution.
